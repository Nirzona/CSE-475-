# Assignment 3: Cyber Threat Detection Using Exploring Ensemble Learning and Explainable AI         


This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify network traffic as benign or malicious using ensemble learning techniques like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting. It also integrates SHAP and LIME for accurate and interpretable predictions, enhancing cybersecurity.
